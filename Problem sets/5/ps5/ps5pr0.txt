Ray Kurzweil is a unique character of our time. He successfully predicted many of things that exist in today's life. I have done my research about Kurzweil, and some of his predictions make sense and just cannot wait for it to happen. For instance, by 2049 food will be commonly "assembled" by nanomachinesI. However, some predictions sound very scary, like in the year 2099 Machines will have attained equal legal status with humans. 
	I recently read Kurzweil's recent book "How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed," and it is an astonishing book. I certainly look forward to the future that Kurzweil mentioned. The idea of connecting our brains to the cloud is phenomenal, imagine what we could do with that? Everyone will have the chance to win on Trivia. But, no one wants the annoying ads to appear inside their brain when they are searching on the cloud.
