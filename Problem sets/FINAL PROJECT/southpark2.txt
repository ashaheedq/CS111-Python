TOOTH FAIRY 2000
INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Cartman's mother is sitting on the couch drinking coffee,
when suddenly her son Eric comes bolting down the stairs.
CARTMAN
MOM!!!! MOM!!!!
Cartman is in his pajamas and his hair is all russled from
sleeping.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)
MOM, SERIOUSLY! SOMETHING WONDERFUL HAS
HAPPENED!!!
MRS. CARTMAN
What is it, snookums?
Cartman holds out two dollars.
CARTMAN
Mom look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth
under my pillow and she gave me TWO
DOLLARS!!! She's only given me a lousy
quarter before!!
MRS. CARTMAN
Oh, my! She must think that YOU are a
very special little muffin!
CARTMAN
(jumping up and down)
YEAH! THIS IS SO TITS!!!
MRS. CARTMAN
Don't say 'tits', Eric.
CARTMAN
Oh, I mean, THIS IS SO COOL!!!
Cartman quickly throws on his coat over his pajamasMRS.
CARTMAN
Well, perhaps now you should take that
money and open up a savings account for
you that has compounded daily interest.
CARTMAN
You can compound daily my ass with
interest, mom, I'M going to the toy store
and buying me a skateboard!
MRS. CARTMAN (O.C.)
But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy
wants you to use that money to learn
about SAVING.
Cartman now throws on his hat.
CARTMAN
Mom, YOU don't know what the tooth fairy
wants me to do with this money, okay?
YOU'RE not the tooth fairy. I'll see you
later!!
Cartman runs out of frame.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)
OH MAN, THIS IS SO TITS!!!!
EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING
Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are at the bus stop, staring blankly.
A VERY FAINT noise is heard... Like a dying cat...
CARTMAN (OFF SCREEN)
YOU GUYS!! YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT!!!
MY GOD YOU GUYS, SERIOUSLY!!!
The noise gets louder and louder.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)
JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR THIS YOU GUYS!!!
I'M RICH!! I'M TOTALLY RICH!!! AREN'T YOU
STOKED!?!
Finally, the sounds is fully audible as Cartman runs into
frame.
STAN
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?
KYLE
He's fat and he's stupid.
CARTMAN
Look at what the tooth fairy left me last
night!
He pulls out the two dollars.
STAN
Two dollars!
KYLE
No way!
STAN
For one tooth?!
CARTMAN
For one tooth.
STAN
Dude, every time I lost a tooth, I only
got a quarter!
KYLE
I only got a jar of gilfelte fish!
CARTMAN
Well that doesn't matter, because I have
an idea that is totally tits.
KYLE
Totally what?
Cartman looks around suspiciously, then moves in closer to
the other boys.
CARTMAN
Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy is
being so cool to me, maybe she's hot for
me, I don't know, but if we ALL pitch in
with teeth, then I could hide them under
my pillow and we could get enough money
to buy a Sega Dreamcast.
THE BOYS
(wide-eyed)
SEGA DREAMCAST?!
CARTMAN
All we need is teeth.
STAN
I already lost all my baby teeth.
KYLE
Me too.
They all look at Kenny.
KENNY
(Covering his mouth)
Nuh-uh.
KYLE
You still have baby teeth, Kenny!?
Stan, Kyle and Cartman all look back at each other and smile.
KENNY
NO WAY!!
CARTMAN
Kenny, think about it! Don't you want
Sega Dreamcast?!
KENNY
NO! I DON'T! FUCK YOU!
CARTMAN
Alright! Kenny's IN you guys!! TITS!!
CUT TO:
EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATER THAT DAY
Kenny is taped to a pole on the playground. He has a string
tied to one of his teeth. Stan and Cartman are with him.
STAN
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's
tooth.
(calling offscreen)
You ready over there?!
The CAMERA PANS, following the string to its other end, which
Kyle is tying to the wheelchair of a little retarded kid
named Timmy.
KYLE
(working feverishly)
Almost! You ready, Timmy?
TIMMY
TIMMY!!!!!!!
KYLE
When I say GO, you slam your electric
wheelchair into high gear okay, Timmy?
TIMMY
TIMMY!!!!!
KYLE
Right, you're Timmy.
TIMMY
TIMMY!!!
KENNY
Mphm mmphmmph mmph?
CARTMAN
I'll tell you why it has to be you,
Kenny. Because you're family is poor and
therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your
teeth are gonna fall out someday anyway.
If you think about it, you should
actually be thanking us.
(in a different voice)
Oh, thank you, Eric.
(back to his voice)
You're welcome, Kenny.
KENNY
(fuck you)
Mmmph mmph!
KYLE
Alright, get ready Timmy.
TIMMY
TIMMY!!!
Butters now approaches Cartman, Stan and Kenny.
BUTTERS
Hey you guys, what are you doing?
STAN
What does it look like we're doing,
Butters? We need a tooth so we're using
Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of
Kenny's.
BUTTERS
Oh. Hey, I got a loose tooth right here!
The boys stop.
BOYS
You WHAT?
KENNY
Mou MPRH?!
TIMMY
Timmy!
BUTTERS
Yup, one a mine came out not two hours
ago.
STAN
Uh... Butters, could we have it?
BUTTERS
Well heck no, you can't have it. Why I'm
gonna stick it under my pillow and get
money from the tooth fairy. She's gives
me fifty cents a tooth!
TIMMY
Wah!
BUTTERS
Well, I'll see ya, fellas.
Butters walks away and the boys watch him go.
KYLE
Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth
out of Kenny's mouth.
STAN
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
KENNY
Woo-Hoo!
CARTMAN
How are we gonna get it from him?
STAN
I guess we'll have to sneak into his
house after he goes to sleep.
KYLE
Yeah! Let's go!
TIMMY
GO?! TIMMY GO!
Timmy hits the throttle with his hand, and his electric chair
SPEEDS off!
But the rope tightens and Kenny's tooth holds firm. Timmy's
chair peels out and kicks up dust.
TIMMY (CONT'D)
YEAH TIMMMYYYYYY!
KYLE
NO! TIMMY, WAIT!
TIMMY
TIMMY!
The rope tightens and tightens, but Kenny's tooth is holding
firm.
KENNY
MRRRM NRMMM!!!!!
Finally, Kenny's ENTIRE NAKED BODY comes flying out of his
coat, through the hood.
Kenny's Body stays on its side, backside to us, as it leaps
through the air and lands at the ground in front of Cartman.
KENNY (CONT'D)
OOMPH!!
Kenny's little butt is pointed at camera.
CARTMAN
HA, HA, HAA! YOU GUYS! I CAN SEE KENNY'S
LITTLE PING A LING! HA HA!!
KENNY
(Moans in pain)
Timmy stops his chair, and looks back.
TIMMY
Agh!
EXT. BUTTERS HOUSE - NIGHT
Establishing.
INT. BUTTERS BEDROOM
Butters is sleeping soundly in his bed.
Suddenly, Cartman appears outside of Butter's window. He
dangles.
CARTMAN
(From outside the window)
Higher, you guys!
EXT. BUTTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
We now see that the three boys are holding Cartman up by a
large Pole with a rope attached to Cartman's back.
STAN
(straining)
Jesus Christ, why'd we pick the fat guy
to be the tooth fairy?
Cartman gets to Butter's window, and slams into it, head
first.
CARTMAN
Ow! Careful you assholes!
Cartman opens Butters windowINT.
BUTTERS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Butters is fast asleep snoring in his feety pajamas.
Cartman enters the room through the window, dangling by the
rope on the stick, and swinging a little bit uncontrollably.
CARTMAN
(Quietly)
To the left you guys, left!
Cartman starts floating to HIS left.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)
No, Camera left, Camera left!!
Cartman floats back over Butters.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)
(Whispering)
That's it! Now down!
Cartman now gently reaches under Butters' pillow and pulls
out the tooth. He holds it up and examines it like a jewel
thief would a diamond and puts it in a little pouch.
He then grabs a shiny quarter and puts it under the pillow
when suddenlyBUTTERS
(waking up)
What the-? Who's there?
Cartman just dangles by the rope, looking panicked.
BUTTERS (CONT'D)
Who is that?!
Cartman dangles a little more, thenCARTMAN
(a la Glenda the Good Witch)
I am the tooth fairy, my child.
BUTTERS
Oh! Sorry, Ms. Fairy!
(Closing his eyes REALLY tight)
I didn't mean to gaze at you! I'm back
asleep now, see?
CARTMAN
Yes, Now I will leave you tidings under
your pillow...
Cartman snags Butter's tooth and leaves him a quarter.
BUTTERS
(Sneaking a peek)
Gosh, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
CARTMAN
AY!
KYLE
(Whispering)
Come on, fat ass!
Cartman tugs on the rope, and the boys start to pull him
outside.
CARTMAN
Do not open your eyes until morning, or
else I will kick you in the nuts...
BUTTERS
Y-yes ma'am!
EXT. BUTTERS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Exhausted, the boys lower Cartman to the ground. They throw
down the pole and run up to Cartman.
STAN
Well?!
Cartman looks at the boys, then pulls the tooth out and holds
it up to camera.
CARTMAN
Bullseye!
INT. CARTMAN'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
Mrs. Cartman is tucking Cartman into bed, singing him a
lullaby.
MRS. CARTMAN
(singing)
Tucky tucky time.
It's the best time of the night.
CARTMAN
I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
MRS. CARTMAN
No, honey, mommy's gotta save her throat.
I have to work tonight.
CARTMAN
Okay.
MRS. CARTMAN
Good night.
As Mrs. Cartman walks off, she notices Eric putting Butter's
tooth under his pillow.
MRS. CARTMAN (CONT'D)
What do you have there, Eric?
CARTMAN
Another tooth fell out today! I'm leaving
it for the tooth fairy!
MRS. CARTMAN
Oh my! The tooth fairy will have to give
you a BIG surprise for losing two teeth
in two days!
CARTMAN
I know, huh?!
EXT. BUSSTOP - DAY
Again, Stan, Kyle and Kenny are standing at the busstop, just
blinking.
And again, we hear the distant soundCARTMAN

RATIONAL THOUGHT, YOU GUYS!!!
Cartman comes running into frame.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)

Did the tooth fairy come?!
Cartman holds out a wad of bills.
CARTMAN
FOUR DOLLARS.
The boys all stare wide-eyed.
STAN

INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - CROSS CUTTING
A dentist, DOCTOR ROBERTS, in his dentist office, is on the
other end.
HEAD DENTIST
Oh yes, Ms. Cartman, what can I do for
you?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Well, it's my son. He's lost A LOT of his
baby teeth, and I was starting to get
worried.
HEAD DENTIST
Well, losing baby teeth is a natural
thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
About a hundred and twelve.
The Dentist just sits there on the phone, incredulous. He
blinks a few times.
HEAD DENTIST
A hundred and twelve.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Yes. Fifteen of them in one night.
Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
HEAD DENTIST
Your son wouldn't happen to be an
ALLIGATOR, would he?
(Listening)
No? Hmm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't
help you right now, the American Dental
Association convention is this week. But
as soon as I get back, I'll look into it.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER
Oh thank you. Freebie next week?
HEAD DENTIST

EXT. SOUTH PARK - MORNING
The sun rises.
INT. CARTMAN'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
Cartman checks under his pillowCARTMAN
Ti-

CARTMAN (CONT'D)
Tooth?
Suddenly, the montage and the MONTAGE MUSIC comes to an
abrupt HALT.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)
What the hell? MAAAA?!
Mrs. Cartman comes rushing in.
MRS. CARTMAN
Yes, Eric?
CARTMAN
The stupid tooth fairy forgot to bring me
money last night! Call the police!
MRS. CARTMAN
Oh... Eric poopie, sit down, Mommy has
something to tell you. It's just that,
well, there IS no tooth fairy, Eric.
Cartman stares blankly.
MRS. CARTMAN (CONT'D)
I'VE been putting all that money under
your pillow, and because you've had so
many teeth fall out, I've actually run
out of money, and can't go to the grocery
store for at least a month.
CARTMAN
Ha, ha... You almost had me for second
there, mom! There's no tooth fairy!
I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no
Santa Claus or Easter Bunny or Jesus
either!
Cartman's mom looks down, ashamed.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)
Mom?
MRS. CARTMAN
I'm sorry, Eric... All children find out
sooner or later.
Slowly, Cartman drops his smile.
CARTMAN
You're seriously? There really is no
tooth fairy?
MRS. CARTMAN
No honey, it's just aCARTMAN
How could you lie to me mother? Lie
right to my face?
MRS. CARTMAN
Oh Eric, it's just part of being a childCARTMAN
How can I trust you, how can I trust
anyone, ever again, mother?!
Cartman gets up and heads towards the door as SOAP OPERA
music starts to play.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)
I guess that to make it in this life I
can only trust myself!
(Looking at his PJs)
Myself and Willikins Bear, Of course...
MRS. CARTMAN
Eric! Eric waitCARTMAN
NO MOTHER!! NO MORE LIES!!
He storms out.
EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Cartman exits his house and joins Stan, Kyle and Kenny who
are waiting for him. Cartman is in a real huffy.
He walks right past the boys and keeps walking like a man
determined. They run after him.
STAN
Dude, where's the money?
CARTMAN
There is no more money.
KYLE
No more money?!
STAN
What are you talking about, Cartman?
We're only a hundred and sixty-seven
dollars away from getting a Sega.
CARTMAN
I know!
KYLE
Cartman, what's going on?
Cartman finally stops and faces the others.
CARTMAN
You guys... Oh, God I don't even know how
to tell you this...
STAN
Tell us what?
CARTMAN
You guys... There's.... There's no tooth
fairy you guys. There I said it.
The other boys stand in shock.
KYLE
What do you mean there's no tooth fairy?
CARTMAN
My mom's been giving us the money all
this time. YOUR parents are the ones who
left you money.
STAN
Dude...
KYLE
That can't be, my parents wouldn't lie to
me.
CARTMAN
But now my mom's given us so much money
that she's bankrupt and we're poor like
Kenny.
They stand in silence. Kenny puts a hand on Cartman's
shoulder.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)
Don't touch me, Kenny.
The boys just sit there looking stunned some more.
KYLE
You're wrong. If my dad says something is
real, then it's REAL!
CARTMAN
Kyle, open your eyes, man!
KYLE
(Storming off)
IT'S NOT TRUE!
INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY
Kyle's father is sitting on the couch reading a newspaper. We
hear a DOOR open and close, and Kyle walks in from frame
right.
KYLE'S DAD
Oh, hello, son!
KYLE
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
KYLE'S DAD
What? Oh...
Kyle's dad sets the paper down.
KYLE'S DAD (CONT'D)
Kyle, let's have a little talk...
KYLE
Oh my God... You DID lie to me!
KYLE'S DAD
No... Kyle, she's just make believe. Like
Peter Pan.
KYLE
Peter Pan too!?!
KYLE'S DAD
Kyle...
Kyle turns back around and faces his father, incredulous.
KYLE
What about Moses and ABRAHAM?!
KYLE'S DAD
Well, they were probably real...
KYLE
Probably!? Is Atlantis real?
KYLE'S DAD
Probably not.
KYLE
AAH!
KYLE'S DAD
But Kyle, adults make those things up
because they're fun for children.
KYLE
(Breaking)
FUN FOR CHILDREN?! FUN FOR CHILDREN?!
LOOK AT ME, DAD!!! I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S REAL ANYMORE?! AHHH!!
Kyle leaves, slamming the door behind him.
EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
Kenny, Cartman and Kyle are sitting on the sidewalk, in front
of the stores, with their heads in their hands. They're
pouting.
CARTMAN
Man, I can't believe ALL our parents lied
to us about the tooth fairy.
KYLE
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's
real?
CARTMAN
No, man, that's just a TV show.
Stan walks up looking happy.
STAN
You guys, you guys!! I figured it out!!!
CARTMAN
What, that your parents lied to you too?
STAN
Yeah, but it's okay! We can still get our
Sega Dreamcast!
CARTMAN
How?
STAN
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up,
right?
KYLE
All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
STAN
So all we have to do... is go to a really
rich kid's house! Put our tooth under his
pillow, wait for his parents to leave him
a whole BUTTLOAD of money, and then sneak
back in and TAKE IT!!!
Cartman and Kenny smile.
KENNY
(Standing up)
Woo-Hoo!
STAN
The kid will never even know!
CARTMAN
(Standing up)
Oh dude that is tits! I mean that is big,
fat Oprah tits right there!
KYLE
(Still sitting)
Oh my God - What if I'M not real?
STAN
We can take the bus to the city. There's
super rich people down there!
CARTMAN
Yeah!
The three boys dash off frame left.
KYLE
I mean, what if I'm just a part of my
parents reality?
Stan runs back and grabs Kyle by his jacket.
STAN
(Dragging Kyle)
Come on, Kyle!
KYLE
What if this is all somebody's dream?
EXT. DENVER SKYLINE - NIGHT
Establishing.
PAN TO:
EXT. CHERRY CREEK - NIGHT
A rich suburb of Denver with a sign reading "Welcome to
Cherry Creek, The Wealthiest Neighborhood in Colorado!"
A city bus pulls up and drops the four boys off, Cartman
already in his little tooth fairy outfit. The bus pulls
away, leaving our four boys in the quiet.
They walk up the street, admiring all the big houses.
CARTMAN
Wow, look at the size of these houses!
STAN
I told you dude. Cherry Creek is the
richest part of Denver. I'll bet these
kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from
the-
(again with he quotation marks)
-tooth fairy.
CARTMAN
Hey! That house looks perfect!
Cartman points to a fancy, Tudor style mansion with Big
Wheels and other toys laying about.

EXT. FANCY TUDOR STYLE MANSION - NIGHT
The kids sneak around the back of the house.
STAN
Here! You can tell this is the kid's
window 'cuz its got Mega Man stickers on

Stan and Kyle get the pole and rope ready, while Cartman
checks his costume.
STAN (CONT'D)
Cartman, once you're in the kid's room,
leave the tooth under the pillow then
come back out. We'll wait for the parents
to see it and leave money, then swing you
back in to grab it!
CARTMAN
Got it!
The boys hoist Cartman up off the ground and slowly start to
lift him into the window.
STAN
This is the smartest business venture
ever!
Cartman dangles over to the window... Dangles... Almost
there... When suddenly, he comes face to face with another
kid hanging by rope on a pole, dressed like the tooth fairy.
Cartman and the other Tooth Fairy Kid stare at each other for
several seconds.
CARTMAN
What thePULL

fairy's dangle in the middle.
STAN
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
DENVER KID 1
We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich
kid's pillow, then come back and collect
the tooth fairy money that his parents
leave him.
The boys just stand there incredulous.
STAN
Hey! You can't do that!
DENVER KID 1
Why not?
STAN
Because that's what WE'RE doing!
CARTMAN
Yeah, you ripped off our idea!
CITY KID
What the hell are you talking about?!
We've been doing this for over two
years!!
KYLE
Two YEARS?
CITY TOOTH FAIRY

CARTMAN
IT'S BETTER THAN YOUR DRESS!! You look

Cartman and the other tooth fairy start beating the crap out
of each other.
DENVER KID 2
Look, this is OUR turf! You better scram

STAN
You scram! We were here first!
The window opens, and a little rich kid appears in his
pajamas.
RICH KID
What's going on? Oh! It's the tooth
fairies!
DENVER KID 1
Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up!
STAN
YOU woke him up!
RICH KID

Dammit! We thought we were so original!
LOOGIE
Let me ask you something... You were
going to sneak a tooth under this rich
kid's pillow... Then what?
The boys think.
STAN
What do you mean?
LOOGIE
How were the kid's parents going to KNOW
that there was a tooth under their
child's pillow?
The boys think harder.

HEAD DENTIST
Fellow Dentists, as you all know, we are

teeth from all over the country. There

hundred of them, sitting down, and also all Dentists wearing
full gear. The dentists shake their heads.
HEAD DENTIST (CONT'D)
We believe that there can be only ONE
LOGICAL REASON FOR ALL OF THIS...
The image from the slide projector switches to a sketch of a
very bizarre looking creature.
HEAD DENTIST (CONT'D)
A giant, half-chicken, half-squirrel,
that steals either teeth or money from
children as they sleep, in order to build
some kind of giant NEST for it's
genetically superior and potentially
dangerous offspring.
Another MURMUR goes through the crowd.
HEAD DENTIST (CONT'D)
We believe also, that this creature would
have at least a mild understanding of
algebra, and that itOne
of the Dentists in the crowd stands up. His name is
FOLEY.
FOLEY
Uh, excuse me -- I think I have a more
LOGICAL theory...
Everyone turns in their seats to look at Foley. The head
dentist glares at him.
HEAD DENTIST
Well, by all means, Mr. Foley. Enlighten
us.
FOLEY
I think what we've got here, is some kind
of black market tooth racket. Something
where one group is stealing the money and
teeth from another group, for a profit.
The audience breaks out into laughter.
The Head Dentist laughs the hardest,
HEAD DENTIST
Oh, Mr. Foley! You realize how ridiculous
that sounds!
FOLEY
It's not ridiculous, it's very possible!
I've seen it happen before!
HEAD DENTIST
Where?
FOLEY
In Montreal!
Now the audience laughs even harder.
HEAD DENTIST
And where, pray, is this 'Mon-Tree-All?'
FOLEY
Look, I know how to handle this! All we
have to do is bring down the kingpin and
the rest will fall. You'll see, I'll have
it taken care of in a matter of weeks!
HEAD DENTIST
Very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild
goose chase, and meanwhile, we'll deal
with the REAL problems at hand!
FOLEY
I will!
Foley walks out. After a beat, the Head Dentist resumes his
speech.
HEAD DENTIST
Anyway, the half-chicken, half-squirrel,
would most likely be about three to four
and a half feet tall. His large beak is
probably detachable, and works as a
flotation device..
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
Establishing shot of the cafeteria.
ANGLE - cafeteria doors
Two large double doors open, revealing the boys standing

passing incredulous children on the way.
INT. CHEF'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
The boys walks into Chef's kitchen dressed in fancy clothes

CHEF
Hello there, children!

CARTMAN
That's right. Keep the change, my man.
CHEF
Well, look at you cute little crackers!
With your money and your fancy clothes!
And your cell phones! It's almost like
you were...
(Suddenly, he panics)
OH MY GOD!!! CHILDREN, WHAT HAVE I TOLD
YOU ABOUT DRUGS?!?!
BOYS
(In unison)
That there's a time and a place for
everything, and it's called college.
CHEF
That's right! And the only thing worse
than DOING drugs, is DEALING drugs! I'm
gonna tell you about when I was your age,
and got offered drugs...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
Little eight year old Chef, wearing a small little Chef's
hat, is strutting down the street with a little MEXICAN GIRL.
CHEF
(Pitched up)
Ooh, come on, na.
Three older kids step into frame.
OLDER KID
Hey, kid. You wanna try some dope?
GIRL
What?
OLDER KID
Come on kid... Don't you wanna get high?
Chef looks a little nervous. He steps in front of the girl
and thinks about what to say.
CHEF
Hey, man... I don't NEED dope. Let me
sing you a little song...
Music starts.
CHEF (CONT'D)
(Singing)
I can't wait until I grow up
And my weenie gets big and strong
Cuz when it does, I'm gonna bust
And make love to you, Amanda, all night
long!
I'm gonna make love to you, Amanda
In about ten years
OLDER KID
What?
OLDER KID'S FRIEND
What the hell is he talking about?
CHEF
And this toothpick is gonna turn into an
oak tree.
I'm gonna knock you down

Knock you over
STAN
CHEF!
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
Chef is still singing to the boys.
CHEF
Knock you all around... Huh?
STAN
We're not dealing drugs.
CHEF
You're not?
STAN
No.
CHEF
Oh... Well, children, whatever you're
doing... Just remember this -- Having
money may SEEM fun, but... Uh... Oh,
never mind.
BOYS
Thanks Chef.
KYLE
See ya.
The boys walk out.
CHEF
Damn that little Amanda was fine... I
gotta look her up.
Chef walks over to the phone.
INT. CAFETERIA
The boys walk out of Chef's kitchen holding their trays.
STAN
Dude, having this much money is great.
Working for Loogie rules!
CARTMAN
Yeah, but you know, why do we need
Loogie? We know how the trade works, why
don't we do it ourselves and keep all the
profit.
STAN
We can't do that, dude, Loogie will kick
our asses.
CARTMAN
Ah, what the hell is that little Pollock
gonna do. Come on you guys, I say we
create our own mob crime family.
KYLE
Dude, this book says that there could be
infinite alternate realities to every
reality!
CARTMAN
Shut up, Kyle.
INT. LOOGIES - DAY
Loogie is sitting at his table, on the phone.
LOOGIE
THEY'RE WHAT?! THEY'RE NOT GONNA PAY
ME?!?! WHO THE HELL DO THEY THINK THEY
ARE?!?! I WANT THOSE SOUTH PARK KIDS
DEAD! I want their families DEAD! I want
their houses burned to the GROUND!
Suddenly, Loogie notices that Tom Foley from the ADA has
walked in. Loogie slams the walkie talkie down and puts on a
Eddie Haskell smile.
LOOGIE (CONT'D)
(In a sweet kid's voice)
Oh, hi there, mister! My mommy and daddy
are out front if you need them!
FOLEY
Cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley,
I'm with the American Dental Association.
Loogie looks a nervous, but he swallows it and continues to
eat.
LOOGIE
Sit down, Mr. Foley. You want some
spaghetti?
FOLEY
(very serious)
No thanks, I just brushed... I just
wanted to let you know that I'm on to
you.
LOOGIE
I told the ADA a thousand times, I know
nothing about teeth. I'm just an eight
year old boy who likes climbing trees and
playing in puddles.
FOLEY
I AM going to find out who The Boss is
and when I do I'm gonna BUST HIS ASS and
everyone's ass who helped hide his ass!!!
Foley thinks for a second about his awkward sentence, and
then walks away.
INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
Cartman is sitting at his desk.
CARTMAN
So you've brought me four hundred POUNDS
of teeth from China?
THE WEASEL, a scrawny little six year old who actually does
look remarkably like a weasel, walks in looking nervous and
carrying a bag. He slaps it down next to Cartman.
WEASEL
That's right! Yeah, it's all top grade
stuff too... Those Chinese kids are
selling their teeth for peanuts! See!
Cartman takes a tooth out and examines the goods.
CARTMAN
How much?
WEASEL
Well, Tang Lee wants thirty. But I can
cut you a deal for twenty eight. Yeah,
what do you say? Huh?
Cartman bites into a tooth, like he is testing a diamond.
Cartman now pulls a jewelers' glass out of his top drawer and
sticks it in his eye.
CARTMAN
Can I ask you a question, weasel?
WEASEL
Um, well, sure, sure.
CARTMAN
Do you think I'm an idiot?
WEASEL
Huh?
CARTMAN
These are CAT TEETH, you son of a bitch.
You tryin' to sell me four hundred pounds
of cat teeth?
WEASEL
Ooh!
CARTMAN
Get out of my sight!!
WEASEL
AGH!!
Weasel grabs his bag and runs out the door.
CARTMAN
Lousy little scum!
The phone rings. Cartman picks it up.
CARTMAN (CONT'D)
What?!
EXT. BRIDGE - DUSK
Two of the city kids, from the first scene where the boys ran
into the city kids, are holding Kenny by each arm on the edge
of a steel bridge.
CITY KID
(On the cel phone)
This is your last chance, kid! Either you
give the Boss his cut, or else we're
gonna throw your pal into the river
wearing concrete galoshes!!
PULL BACK to reveal that Kenny has concrete galoshes.
KENNY

MUSIC STING!!
INT. CARTMAN'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS
Cartman thinks.
CARTMAN
I ain't giving you crap. Kenny's not
afraid of YOU!!!
Meanwhile, Kyle is sitting on a chair reading a book called
'Taoism and Philosophy'
KYLE
Oh my God, this book says that negative
and positive are the same thing. That
real and not real are one.
EXT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
CITY KID
He's not gonna do it?!
KENNY
Mr's mrt mrnnr mr rm!!
CITY KID
(Into walkie talkie)
He's not gonna do it, boss!
LOOGIE (O.S.)
Well then throw him in!!!
CITY KID
Alright, kid! Time to die!
The two city kids throw Kenny off the bridgeKENNY
MMRRRRPHHH!!!!
But it turns out that the Platte River is only about three
inches deep. Kenny lands, feet first, and just stands there
looking around.
CITY KID
Aw, man! How deep is the Platte river?!

human interest story: Dan Akawawa is
live.
EXT. DENVER - NIGHT
CUT TO Dan in a live feed. He is in front of a large house,
and standing next to a married couple and their sick looking
child.
DAN
Thanks Tom, I'm here at the house of
Little Billy Circlevich. Billy is in
desperate need of a bone marrow
transplant, or he will most certainly
die.
Billy looks worried.
DAN (CONT'D)
Billy, how much more money do you need
for the transplant?
Dan sticks the mic in Billy's face. Billy looks nervous.
BILLY
(Quietly into mic)
Six Hundred Dollars.
DAN
Louder, Billy! We can't hear you!
BILLY
SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS.
DAN
Wow, that's a lot of money. How the hell
are you gonna get all that in the short
amount of time you have left?
BILLY
I don't know.
Billy's parents look shocked.
DAN
Well, Billy, I also understand you also
lost a tooth today.
BILLY
Yeah.
DAN
Billy, we want you to put that tooth
under your pillow tonight. Because we
have a feeling that the TOOTH FAIRY is
going to leave you SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS
FOR IT!!!
Dan hands Billy's parents an envelope, and then winks at
them. The parents look in the envelope and act thrilled.
BILLY
Really?
BILLY'S PARENTS
Really?
DAN
Yes, really. 600 dollars! I might also
mention, that Billy lives in Crestview
apartments, just off Arapahoe road on
Emporia street. Back to you, Tom.
Dan just stands there smiling at the camera for a long time.
DAN (CONT'D)
How was that?
REVERSE to reveal the camera crew, along with Doctor Foley.
FOLEY
Perfect. The trap is set!
CAMERA MAN
Come on, You really think anybody will
fall for something that stupid?
INT. CARTMAN'S MANSION
Cartman's in his hot tub watching TV.
CARTMAN
600 dollars, you guys!
(getting out of the tub)
Come on! Get your stuff together! This
is gonna be tits!
Kyle is reading a book called 'Descartes'
KYLE
Dude, THIS book says that I don't exist
unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
CARTMAN
Will somebody take those books away from
him?
INT. BONE MARROW KID'S HOUSE
Billy is being tucked into bed by his parents.
BILLY'S MOTHER
Be sure to put your loose tooth under
your pillow, Billy.
BILLY
Okay, mom.
EXT. CANCER KID'S HOUSE
A van which reads, "ROTARY PHONE SERVICE" is parked across
the street from the house.
INT. ROTARY PHONE SERVICE VAN
Foley along with a few other ADA OFFICIALS are in the van,
watching the cancer kid's house.
They've got binoculars and video monitors and all kinds of
sound equipment.
Loogie and his goons are in the van with them.
FOLEY
Thank you for helping, gentlemen. If this
sting operation works, some bogus tooth
fairies should be showing up to take the
sick kid's money. When they touch the
kid's pillow and alarm will sound and
that's when you hit the button, Murphy,
and activate lights. Everyone got it?
ADA OFFICIALS
Got it.
MURPHY
Da-h, which button do I hit again, boss?
Everyone stares at Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
Ha, ha. Just kidding. You know how
there's always 'the dumb guy' in sting
operations in the movies? I was just...
Ha, ha...
(Nobody's laughing)
I was acting like -- Ha, ha... Oh.
EXT. SOUTH PARK RIVER - DUSK
Stan, Cartman and Kyle head to the sick kid's house. Cartman
is in tooth fairy gear. Stan and Kyle carry the stick.
(Do this all as one wide shot - they are walking in front of
the river where Kenny is still stuck)
CARTMAN
Hurry up you guys, we got to get that
sick kid's money before Loogie does.
KYLE
I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all
this stuff I've been reading - I really
don't think I exist.
STAN
Dude, just stop thinking about it.
KYLE
But I can't, because what if thinking
about it is the only thing keeping my
space-time together?
As the boys walk, they pass, Kenny in the far, far distance.
KENNY
YOU GUYS!!! YOU GUYS, OVER HERE!!!
KYLE
Sometimes I think I can see time slowing
down, and my own existence fading...
INT. ROTARY PHONE SERVICE VAN
The cancer kid's voice is coming over the sound system as the
ADA guys listen in.
BILLY (V.O.)
Goodnight, mom. Goodnight... dad...
FOLEY
Alright, everyone keep your eyes peeled.
EXT. BONE MARROW KID'S HOUSE
The boys are standing outside the sick kid's window.
BILLY
I'm going to bed now, mommy. I put my
tooth under the pillow. Do you really
thing the tooth fairy will give me money
for the transplant?
BILLY'S FATHER
I think so Billy, I think so.
BILLY
I can't wait to feel healthy and strong
again.
CARTMAN
(overhearing the Cancer kid)
Yeah well, you're gonna have to wait a
little longer, Billy, cuz that six
hundred dollars is MINE.
KYLE
Light is a wave unless it's observed.
That means ALL matter is just a wave...
Nothing's real! Reality and Oh God! It's
happening!!!
Kyle fades away.
STAN
(Looking around, confused)
Kyle?
INT. VAN - NIGHT
MURPHY
Hey, something strange is happening with
the computers...
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
Stan is still looking around for Kyle.
LOOGIE
Well, well, well. What do we have here?
Stan turns around and sees Loogie standing with a bunch of
fairies.
STAN
Oh shit.
LOOGIE
Did you bastards really think you could
hide from me forever? Kloxky, put this
butt wipe out of his misery.
Stan panics.
INT. KID'S ROOM - DAY
CARTMAN
I GOT IT!
Cartman grabs the wod of money. When he does, a LOUD ALARM
and lights go on.
INT. ROTARY PHONE SERVICE VAN - AT THAT MOMENT
Over the sound system we hear the kid shouting...
CANCER KID (V.O.)
The tooth fairy!!
FOLEY
LET'S MOVE OUT!
The ADA guys put on their gear and jump out of the van as
Murphy hits the button.
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
Suddenly, Loogie and the other kids find themselves
surrounded by Dentists.
LOOGIE
Oh crap!
FOLEY
GIVE IT UP, KIDS! YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY
DENTISTS!!!!
LOOGIE
It was a trap...
FOLEY
That's right. And now its all exposed.
You're through. The only thing left to do
is haul you kids ALL TO PRISON!!!
The Dentists move in. But Just then, Kyle's head,
superimposed appears over the frame.
KYLE
(Echoing voice)
This is reality. I am everywhere and
nowhere...
FOLEY
What the hell?
CARTMAN
Kyle?
Kyle starts to bend reality.
KYLE
I am nothing and everything.
The frame fills with images of stars and embryos.
Kyle's head stretches and contorts as it floats through
frame.
Suddenly, the large, half chicken, half squirrel walks
through frame.
CHICKEN-SQUIRREL
RAR!!!
HEAD DENTIST
A-HA!! I TOLD YOU!!!
The chicken attacks the dentists and they all run away.
FOLEY
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!
The tooth fairies run away too, screaming.
Finally, all the action calms down. Everything gets quiet, as
the only ones left are Stan, Cartman and Loogie.
Kyle reappears.
KYLE
Huh, that was pretty weird.
LOOGIE
Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup
all along!!! How could I be so stupid?!
STAN
What?
LOOGIE
I can't believe I fell for such an
obvious TRAP!!! What the hell's wrong
with me?!?!
CARTMAN
Well... Don't take it too hard, dude.
That's what grown ups do. They lie. Lie
right to your face.
LOOGIE
Oh well, maybe its good my empire has
fallen.
STAN
Really?
LOOGIE
Yeah, I kind of wanted to play on the
flag football team this year anyway.
STAN
So, you're not gonna hurt us or nothing?
LOOGIE
Nah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole
thing's over with.
KYLE
Yeah, but you know, I've learned
something today...
Our typical guitar music starts to play.
KYLE (CONT'D)
You see, the basis of all reasoning is
the mind's awareness of itself. What we
think, the external objects we perceive,
are all like actors that come on and off
stage. But our consciousness, the stage
itself, is always present to us.
Stan, Cartman and Loogie just stare blankly at Kyle.
CARTMAN
Tits.
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY
Some birds CHIRP as Kenny still stands in the River. He is
sideways to us now, trying to hop his way to the river edge.
Hop...
Hop...
He then hops into a hole and drowns.
Timmy rides by in his chair.
TIMMY
TIMMY!!!
