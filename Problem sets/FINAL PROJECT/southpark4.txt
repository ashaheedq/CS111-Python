INT. SCHOOL - DAY
MR. GARRISON
Okay, children we have a special guest
today. A woman recruiting young people
for a national choir tour.
MRS. STEVENS, the choir teacher steps in with a group of
kids with ‘G.G.W.K.’ sweatshirts on.
MR. GARRISON
Now, I know that choir tours are
totally stupid and lame, but PLEASE
give her your full attention.
(To choir teacher)
Go ahead.
The Choir Teacher looks at Mr. Garrison oddly, and then
steps in front of him.
CHOIR TEACHER
Uh, thank you... Mr. Garrison. HOW ARE
WE ALL DOING TODAY?!
No response.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
I CAN’T HEAR YOU! I SAID HOW ARE WE
ALL DOING?!
Silence. Cartman farts.
MR. GARRISON
ERIC CARTMAN, YOU SAY EXCUSE ME!!
CARTMAN
Okay.
MR. GARRISON
Go ahead.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Children, we are a national choir
called ‘Getting Gay With Kids!’! We’re
gonna do a BIG tour down in Central
America to help Save the Rainforest
and YOU CAN BE A PART OF IT!!
Nobody looks interested.
KENNY
Mph rmph rm.
The boys LAUGH.
MR. GARRISON
KENNY McKORMICK YOU SPEAK WHEN YOU’RE
SPOKEN TO!! Go ahead.
CHOIR TEACHER
You see, we take kids from all over
the country, and put them in a choir
where we sing and dance to raise
awareness about our vanishing
rainforests!
An ugly boy with glasses steps forward.
UGLY BOY
Did you know over ten thousand acres
of rainforest are bulldozed every
year?
Now a cute little blonde girl steps forward. (Her name is
KELLY)
KELLY
That’s right. And over thirty percent
of the world’s oxygen is made in the
rainforest!
Kenny’s eyes grow wide. He is in love.
Kelly smiles back at Kenny. Kenny’s eyes get droopy.
CHOIR TEACHER
So who wants to join the fun?!
CARTMAN
What if you have no rhythm?
CHOIR TEACHER
Excuse me?
CARTMAN
Like my friend Kyle, he Jewish, so he
doesn’t have any rhythm.
KYLE
Shut up, fat ass!!
STAN
Choirs suck.
MR. GARRISON
KYLE BROFLOSKI YOU WATCH YOUR
LANGUAGE!
ERIC CARTMAN YOU BE NICE TO PEOPLE,
STAN MARSH YOU MIND YOUR MANNERS!
KENNY MCKORMICK YOU PAY ATTENTION!
(To choir teacher)
Go ahead.
The Choir Teacher is amazed by Garrison’s ability.
CHOIR TEACHER
Well, uh that’s all, reallyKenny
and the little girl exchange looks again. This
time, the little girl picks her nose.
-So, if anyone is interested in seeing
the rainforest and joining our choir,
I’ll leave information packets up
front.
CARTMAN
That’s good, we need some more toilet
paper.
MR. GARRISON
ALRIGHT, THAT DOES IT!!
INT. COUNSELOR’S OFFICE - DAY
You know that kid that we always see in front of the
Counselor’s office, and the Principal’s office? Well, his
name is CRAIG. And now he is sitting opposite of Mr.
Mackey being scolded.
MR. MACKEY
I’m tired of seeing you in my office,
young man. You get sent here every
day, Craig!
CRAIG
I know.
MR. MACKEY
Why can’t you behave?
CRAIG
I don’t know.
MR. MACKEY
What do you have to say for yourself?
(beat)
Well I tell you what, young man,
you’re gonna held back a grade if you
don’tCraig
flips him off.
MR. MACKEY
Did you just flip me off?!
CRAIG
No.
MR. MACKEY
Yes you did! You just flipped me the
bird! Now see, that is exactly what
I’m talking about. If you don’t shape
up, mkay, and get your head straightCraig
lifts his middle finger again.
MR. MACKEY
THERE! YOU FLIPPED ME OFF AGAIN!
CRAIG
No I didn’t.
MR. MACKEY
Yes you did! And until you stop
flipping people off you can just go
back to the waiting room, mkay! NEXT!
Craig gets up just as the door opens and our four boys
walk in.
MR. MACKEY
Well, well, well, mkay, if it isn’t
Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Eric.
KYLE
Hey, Craig.
(We can’t see Craig as he walks out, his back is to us.)
CARTMAN
HEY! Don’t flip me off, you son of a
bitch!
MR. MACKEY
Sit down, boys. Now let’s see what did
Mr. Garrison send YOU in here for?
Mackey reads over a piece of paper.
MR. MACKEY
‘The boys were being rude while a
Choir Teacher was giving some stupid
presentation.’
STAN
It just some dumb activist kids choir
thing.
MR. MACKEY
Uh, Young man, Getting Gay With Kids
is not dumb, mkay. It just so happens
that I am on the board of directors!
KYLE
Dude, all those choirs are the same.
They don’t even really sing they use
pre-recorded tapes!
MR. MACKEY
Well guess what, boys? I think that
Getting Gay with kids is just what you
need. I’m going to sign up all four of
you.
STAN
What?!
KYLE
You can’t do that!
KENNY
Woo-hoo!!
the other boys look at Kenny oddly. Kenny quickly lowers
his arms and tries to look bummed.
KENNY
(muffled, of course)
I mean... Aw!
MR. MACKEY
I think this will be very good for
you.
STAN
But we don’t even CARE about the
rainforest!
MR. MACKEY
And that’s exactly why you need to go,
mkay.
CARTMAN
(On his knees)
Please, Mr. Mackey, we’ll be good!
Don’t send us to that ol’ kids choir!
Have mercy, Mr. Mackey!
EXT. CARTMAN’S HOUSE - DAY
The boys’ mothers are loading their kids into the big,
Getting Gay With Kids bus. The Choir Teacher stands at
the bus door, holding a clipboard.
KYLE’S MOTHER
Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back
from the rainforest.
CHOIR TEACHER
Oh, no, no, no. The Rainforest is very
fragile. We must take only pictures
and leave only footprints.
KYLE’S MOTHER
Oh, I didn’t realize.
ODD KID
(Out the bus window)
Did you know that right now,
bulldozers are tearing down thousands
of acres of rainforest every day?
CARTMAN
Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey
balls.
Stan’s mother is dragging Stan by the arm towards the big
Getting Gay With Kids bus.
STAN
Please don’t make me go on a choir
tour, mom! PLEASE!
STAN’S MOTHER
Stan, you should be excited! I would
love to see the rainforest. Besides,
your dad and I need some time alone.
STAN
Noooooo!
Stan’s mother pitches him into the bus like a load of
laundry.
The doors close and the bus heads away.
INT. BUS - DAY
The choir teacher stands at the front of the bus.
CHOIR TEACHER
Okay Children, That’s all of us! We’re
ready to head for the Latin American
nation of Costa Rica, a country filled
with virgin rainforest.
CARTMAN
Whoopee.
CHOIR TEACHER
And you must be Eric Cartman. I heard
about you. You don’t respect nature or
other cultures.
CARTMAN
Yeah, pretty much.
CHOIR TEACHER
Well, I’m gonna change the way you
think, kiddo.
Kenny sits down right next to the little blond girl. They
look at each other while sweet music plays. Finally, the
little girl speaks.
LITTLE BLOND GIRL
My name’s Kelly.
KENNY
Mph rm rmhpm.
LITTLE BLOND GIRL
Lenny?
KENNY
Mph, RMHPM.
LITTLE BLOND GIRL
Johnny?
KENNY
RMHPM!!!
LITTLE BLOND GIRL
(Picking her nose)
Oh.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Now we’ve got a LONG trip ahead of us,
so let’s that the opportunity to learn
our choreography!
CARTMAN
The nightmare begins...
EXT. BUS - DAY
The bus travels south down to Latin America.
INT. BUS - DAY
The bus drives on.
CHOIR TEACHER
Oh look, children! I think we’re
entering San Jose, which is the
capital of Costa Rica!
The kids all look out their windows.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont'd)
Oh, this is so exciting!
CARTMAN
Oh my God, dude, look how dirty and
crappy everything is!
CHOIR TEACHER
Eric, Costa Rica is a third world
country. These people are much poorer
than those in the U.S.
CARTMAN
Well why they hell don’t they get
jobs?
EXT. BUS - DAY
As the bus drives through the poorest part of town,
Cartman sticks his head out the window.
CARTMAN
AY! Why don’t you people quit slacking
off and get a job?! What’s wrong with
you?! Go to college!!
INT. BUS - DAY
CHOIR TEACHER
Eric, sit down!
CARTMAN
Look, you gotta be firm with these
people or they’ll slack off and be
poor forever. Right, Kenny?
Kenny glares at Cartman.
CARTMAN
Hey maybe that’s it, Kenny. Maybe
you’re Costa Rican and that’s why your
family is so poor!
Kenny looks at Kelly, worried about what she thinks.
KENNY
Mph rmph rm.
KELLY
Your family ISN’T poor?
Kelly goes back to picking her nose.
CARTMAN
Woa, dude! Look over there!!
EXT. BUS - DAY
Three scantily dressed Costa Rican WOMEN are on the
street corner waving to cars that drive by.
INT. BUS - DAY
CARTMAN
Wow! Costa Rican Prostitutes! Hey look
at the prostitutes, you guys!
The prostitutes notice Cartman staring at them, and get
angry.
PROSTITUTE
(Thick accent)
What are Jew looking at, main?!
PROSTITUTE 2
(thick accent)
Hey, Why don’t you take a picture?
Cartman holds up his empty hands to eyes.
CARTMAN
(thick accent)
Okay, Cleeeeeek!
CHOIR TEACHER
Eric! Sit down!
EXT. SAN JOSE NATIONAL HALL - DAY
The bus pulls up to the National Hall and the kids all
pour out.
CHOIR TEACHER
Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capital
building! This is where all the
leaders of the Costa Rican Government
make theirCARTMAN
Oh God it smells like ass out here!
CHOIR TEACHER
Alright, that does it!
The Choir teacher grabs Cartman’s arm and leans down in
his face.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Eric Cartman you respect other
cultures THIS INSTANT!
CARTMAN
I wasn’t saying anything about their
culture, I was just saying their city
smells like ass.
Meanwhile, Kenny and Kelly are standing off to the side.
KELLY
Wow... Seeing a place like this really
makes you appreciate living in
America, huh?
KENNY
(Dreamy eyed)
Mph-hm.
Kelly picks her nose.
CHOIR TEACHER
(Continuing)
You may think that making fun of third
world countries is funny, but let meCARTMAN
I don’t think it’s funny! This place
is overcrowded, smelly and poor --
that’s not funny, that sucks!
The Choir Teacher sighs.
CHOIR TEACHER
Eric, will you please, PLEASE, just
keep your mouth shut while we present
ourselves to the Costa Rican
President?
CARTMAN
Why?
CHOIR TEACHER
(Out the side of her mouth)
Because I’ll buy you some ice cream
afterwards if you do.
CARTMAN
Eh-OH!
INT. SAN JOSE NATIONAL HALL - DAY
The kids are standing in a large hall decorated with
flags and pictures of Costa Rican leaders. The Choir
Teacher is standing in front of them, talking right into
cameraCHOIR
TEACHER
Well, it was a long trip, but the
children are VERY excited to sing
tomorrow!
Now we see the reverse angle. A big Costa Rican LEADER
sits behind a crappy desk. And a few other official
looking Costa Ricans stand beside him. They all look
confused.
LEADER
Que?
CHOIR TEACHER
Uh... We’re the choir... that was sent
from the United States.
LEADER
Que?
CHOIR TEACHER
We’re the group singing for the save
the rainforest summit tomorrow? Oh
dear, where is Mr. Mackey he should
have been here by now...
The Costa Ricans still just look confused.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Children, do any of you speak Spanish?
The kids all just stand there and blink. Kelly picks her
nose. Finally, Cartman raises his hand.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Don’t you DARE.
Cartman slowly lowers his hand. Just then, Mr. Mackey
walks in.
MR. MACKEY
Sorry I’m late.
CHOIR TEACHER
Oh thank goodness you’re here, I don’t
speak any Spanish.
MR. MACKEY
Oh, no problem.
(Talking to leader)
Uh ustedes choir de Estados Unidos,
Mbien. (We’re the choir from the
United States)
LEADER
Oh... Oh! Save Da Rainforest!
CHOIR TEACHER
Yes!
LEADER
Pablo los llevara en un tur de la
jungla. (Pablo will take you on a
rainforest tour)
MR. MACKEY
Uh, he says Pablo here will take you
on a rainforest tour.
The rainforest guide steps out and waves.
CHOIR TEACHER
Oh boy! Mr. Presedente, round up all
your subjects outside! We have a
special gift for you! The gift... Of
song!
PRESIDENTE
Que?
EXT. SAN JOSE NATIONAL HALL - DAY
The kids are all gathered on the small square in front of
the old, dirty building. They absolutely sparkle in their
neat, Getting Gay With Kids shirts and white gloves.
CHOIR TEACHER
Alright children, let’s get in our
rows quickly so we can begin!
STAN
I don’t remember all the words!
CHOIR TEACHER
That’s okay, jut sing with the tape.
Nobody will notice.
The kids get in their rows.
The Presidente and his people look confused.
KELLY
Did you remember all the choreography,
Lenny?
KENNY
(I think so)
Rm rmph rm.
The Choir teacher turns around and addresses the poor
Costa Ricans.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Hello, everybody! This is just a
little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we
may be a little rusty, ha ha ha...
The Choir Teacher pulls a large boom box out of nowhere
and presses ‘play’. Gay music begins.
KIDS
(Singing)
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. Zat A Doot A Waa.
There is a place that is magical and
full of rain. But now it needs help
because it is in pain. Cleaning the
earth is a mighty big chore. But we’re
spreading awareness like never before.
The poor Costa Ricans look on with confusion.
The choir teacher happily directs. She gestures for the
kids to put bigger smiles on their faces.
KIDS
(singing)
Getting gay with kids is here. To
spread the word and bring you cheer.
Let’s save the rainforest. What do you
say? Being an activist is totally gay.
The kids all do a little choreography along with the
song. It’s obvious that Kyle has no clue what is going
KIDS
(singing)
Someday if we work hard boys and
girls,
there’ll be nothing but rainforest
covering the entire world.
(beat)
Getting gay with kids is here. To
spread the word and bring you cheer.
Getting gay with kids is here. So save
the rainforest. Totally gay. It’s
totally gay.
They finish with flourish but Kyle is still out of sync
with everybody else.
The Costa Ricans turn and go about their business now
that this distraction is over.
CHOIR TEACHER
Great job, gang!
She walks over to Kyle.
CHOIR TEACHER
You were really all over the place,
Kyle.
KYLE
Thanks.
CARTMAN
I told you Jewish people don’t have
rhythm.
KYLE
FUCK OFF CARTMAN!!!
STAN
No, dude... I think Cartman might
actually be right.
KYLE
No... Tha-- That’s a stereotype!
STAN
Dude... Maybe you really DON’T have
any rhythm!
Kyle looks scared. Dramatic MUSIC STING.
ACT 2
INT. RAINFOREST - DAY
The group is hiking through dense rainforest, led by the
Costa Rican guide.
COSTA RICAN GUIDE
This is now secondary rainforest we
are entering. Notice the canopy of
foliage.
CHOIR TEACHER
(Taking pictures)
Oh, it’s everything I ever dreamed it
would be!!
Stan steps very gingerly, as if walking through a
minefield. His eyes dart back and forth in search of
snakes.
STAN
AGh! SNAKE!
KYLE
No, dude, that’s a branch.
STAN
Oh. AGH! SNAKE!
KYLE
No, that’s that same branch again.
STAN
Oh.
COSTA RICAN GUIDE
The rainforest is very delicate and we
must take steps to protect it.
CARTMAN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, must take steps to
protect it, bla bla bla.
The guide looks at Cartman oddly.
CARTMAN
We hear this a million times back up
in the states.
The group journeys on.
COSTA RICAN GUIDE
Here look! These are squirrel monkeys!
Endagered inhabitants of rainforest.
As they walk by, a bunch of kids take pictures of the
bored looking monkey.
KELLY
(Taking picture)
Wow, isn’t he neat, Lenny?
Cartman picks up a stick and smacks it on the head.
CARTMAN
BAD! Bad monkey!
The monkey runs away.
CHOIR TEACHER
Eric, what the HECK are you doing?!
CARTMAN
I’m asserting myself. It’s tough love.
Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he’s bad
I say ‘That’s a Bad Mr. Kitty!’ and I
smack him on the head.
The Choir teacher looks confused.
COSTA RICAN GUIDE
And here is a three toed sloth.
Again, Cartman smacks it as he walks through.
CARTMAN
Bad! That’s a BAD three toed sloth!
The Choir teacher grabs Eric and drags him away.
CHOIR TEACHER
ERIC FOR GOD’S SAKE KNOCK IT OFF!!
CARTMAN
(Still trying to hit him)
Respect my authority!
Now the group finally comes to a stop.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great
tour, but I guess we should be heading
back. We have a BIG concert tomorrow,
don’t we kids!
GAY KIDS
YEAH!
UGLY BOY
I wish we could have seen the
Yanagopa!
KYLE
What’s the Yanagopa?
CHOIR TEACHER
The Yanagopa are gentle, Native people
that live in the rainforest. But
bulldozers are destroying their home!
Soon they will have nowhere to go. So,
we must stop bulldozing the rainforest
so that they can liveCARTMAN
AGH GYOD, here she goes AGAIN.
As he’s saying this, Stan notices a medium sized snake
moving slowly in a tree next to Kyle.
STAN
AAAGAHGHGHGAHAGHGHGHGHGH!!!!!!!!
CHOIR TEACHER
Stanly, what is it?!
STAN
SSSNNNAAAAKKKEE!!!!!!
The kids all see the snake and gasp. The guide very
calmly walks over to it.
COSTA RICAN GUIDE
Oh yes, this is what we call a coral
snake. Notice his red markings. Quite
an amazing creature.
STAN
AGAHGHAGHGH!!
COSTA RICAN GUIDE
What’s the matter, little boy?
CARTMAN
He’s a little wuss, what’s it look
like?
STAN
I’m just a-scared of snakes!
COSTA RICAN GUIDE
Now, now, you must remember; This
snake is more afraid of us than we are
of it.
Just then, the snake violently and maliciously leaps out
at the guide, wraps around his neck, and bites him on the
head.
The kids watch in horror as the guide screams and fights
for his life. Stan runs screaming.
In seconds it’s over, and the guide lies on the ground,
dead. The snake bites him a few more times just to be
more evil.
CHOIR TEACHER
OH MY GOD!!!
CARTMAN
Yeah, that snake is really scared of
us alright.
CHOIR TEACHER
Jesus Christ, is he dead?!
STAN
DUDE!!!
KYLE
My guess would be yes.
CHOIR TEACHER
(panicing)
Oh no! God no! Now don’t panic
children.
Cartman walks over to the snake with his stick.
CARTMAN
BAD! That’s a BAD SNAKE!
Cartman whaps the snake, which immediately comes charging
after himCARTMAN
(Running away)
WAAGHGH!!
EXT. RAINFOREST - DUSK
The sun is starting to set as the Choir Teacher leads her
group around aimlessly.
CHOIR TEACHER
Maybe we came from that way... No...
No let’s try this way.
KELLY
Benny, do you think we’re gonna be
okay?
KENNY
Mph. Mrph rm rphm.
KELLY
That’s good... Can I tell you
something?
KENNY
Mph.
KELLY
I think I like you.
KENNY
Mph?!
KELLY
Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate
really well.
KENNY
Mph rm!!
KELLY
No, that’s NOT good.
KENNY
Mph rm rmph?
KELLY
No! See, if I start to like you too
much I’m only going to get my heart
broken. ‘Cause we live on opposite
ends of the country. Once this choir
tour is over, we’ll never see each
other again --
Kelly starts to pick her nose. Kenny pulls her arm away.
KELLY
-and that would devastate me. So I
can’t have feelings for you. I JUST
CAN’T LENNY!!
Kelly melodramatically runs away.
KENNY
AW!
CHOIR TEACHER
Oh children, the sun is setting! We
have to find our way out of here
QUICK!!
EXT. RAINFOREST - DUSK
Shot of the sun going down.
EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
We can just see a silhouette of the rainforest and some
clouds moving through a starry sky.
There is some lightning, and thunder claps.
INT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
This scene is pitch black the whole time, except for very
short bursts of visible animation when lightning strikes.
CHOIR TEACHER
Okay..Okay.. Everything is just fine
kids...It’s important that we all
stick together. Is everybody still
here?
There is a long silence. Finally, one kid speaks up.
VOICE
I’m not.
CHOIR TEACHER
Who’s not?
VOICE
Me.
Huge lightning, huge thunder.
KELLY
Benny, will you hold my hand?
Lightning flickers and we see Kenny take Kelly’s hand.
KELLY
I don’t want to get emotionally
attached, though.
Lightning flashes again, and we see Kenny huddled close
to Kelly. Kelly picking her nose.
STAN
OH MY GOD, DUDE!!! I just saw Tony
Danza!
CHOIR TEACHER
No you didn’t just see Tony Danza,
Stanly!
Lightning flashes and we see Tony Danza sitting next to
the Choir teacher.
EXT. RAINFOREST PEACE SUMMIT - DAY
Meanwhile, the Save The Rainforest Summit is happening
back in San Jose. It’s a pretty big event. A large stage,
lots of banners, and little booths are set up everywhere.
It’s just as big, colorful and stupid as the
Environmental Media Awards.
The following is all done in Spanish, with English
subtitles.
PRESIDENTE
Bueno! Bueno! Pongan el arco iris al
lado las tortugas muertas.
(Good, good! Put the rainbow next to
the picture of the dying sea turtles.)
Mr. Mackey walks up.
MR. MACKEY
Buenas Dias, Senior Presidente.
(Hello, El Presidente.)
PRESIDENTE
Que tal, esta todo bien?
(Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)
MR. MACKEY
Oh, muy bien... Senior Presidente, um,
usted no ha visto el coro, no?
(Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven’t
seen the choir have you?)
PRESIDENTE
QUE!?
(WHAT?!)
MR. MACKEY
Parece que anoche no regresaron al
hotel, mbien.
(Well they never came back to the
hotel last night...)
PRESIDENTE
ESTA BROMEANDO MACKEY? MAS DE CIENMIL
PERSONAS ATENDERAN ESTE EVENTO, Y ME
DICE USTED QUE NO TENDRE A MIS
CHIQUITOS LINDOS PARA QUE LES CANTEN?
CONO! CARAJO!
(YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!! I HAVE
OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE COMING
TO THIS EVENT! ARE YOU TELLING ME I
HAVE NO DARLING LITTLE KIDS TO SING TO
THEM?!)
MR. MACKEY
Estoy seguro que llegaran. No se
preocupe olvidelo, mbien.
(I’m sure they’ll get here... No
problem. Forget I said anything.)
EXT. FOREST - THE NEXT DAY
The sun rises over the rainforest. The group walks
through the foliage.
KYLE
Dude, we’re totally lost. We’re gonna
die out here.
KELLY
We are?!
CHOIR TEACHER
Don’t worry, Kelly, we’re going to
find our way out of the rainforest and
make it back for the concert in time.
We just need to respect our mother
rainforest and she will respect us.
KYLE
Mrs. Stevens, you have a bug on your
back.
CHOIR TEACHER
Oh, Really? Could you brush it off?
She turns around to REVEAL a absolutely huge, horrifying
bug that is actually half her size clinging to her back.
BUG
ROAR!
KYLE
Umm, no.
Now Mrs. Stevens turns her head around to see the
enormity and horror of the bug.
CHOIR TEACHER
AGAHAGAH!!! OH MY GOD!!!
She jumps around like she’s on fire.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
GET IT OFF A ME!!! FOR THE LOVE OF
GOD!! AAGAHAGHG!!! GET IT OFF A ME!!!
OHG MY GOD!!!
The kids eyes go back and forth like They’re watching a
tennis match.
The Choir Teacher finally comes to a stop and catches her
breath.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Okay... Children, we must understand
that the insects of the rainforest
help the delicate balance of life
here.
She turns to walk again and we see that the bug is still
in the exact same spot.
BUG
Roar.
CHOIR TEACHER
AGAHGAHG!!! OH MY GOD!!!
KYLE
The rainforest sucks! I wanna go
home!
KELLY
Me too!
EXT. FOREST - LATER
The whole class is again walking through the rainforest.
Everyone looks nervous. The kids are all MOANING and AD
LIB COMPLAINING.
CHOIR TEACHER
Shh, Children, let’s try to listen to
what the rainforest tells us. If we
use our ears, she can tell us so many
things, perhapsSuddenly,
Kyle runs SMACK into a guy in military
fatigues.
KYLE
AGAHGAHG!!!! THERE’S A DUDE HERE!!
The choir teacher runs up.
CHOIR TEACHER
Oh thank Goodness! Hello sir. We are
lost. Can you help us?
SOLDIER
Que?
Cartman pushes his way to he front.
CARTMAN
Let me try, Let me try-
(speaking slowly)
We are from America. A-MER-I-CA. We
are lost and very hungry. Nesescito
burreeeetos.
He doesn’t answer.
STAN
I don’t want a burrito. I want a taco.
Supreme.
CARTMAN
(motioning to his mouth)
TA-CO.
KYLE
I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
CARTMAN
Two ToSTAAA-DAs. And a EN-CHIR-EE-TO.
CHOIR TEACHER
Boys, please! Not every Spanish person
eats tacos and burritos. That’s a
stereotype
He motions for them to follow.
CHOIR TEACHER
Children, he wants us to follow him!
Oh thank goodness, I think this ordeal
is over!
EXT. MARXIST REBEL’S CAMP.
They walk into a camp of Marxist rebels. A dozen or so
unsavory looking characters all with guns.
STAN
This doesn’t look very safe.
KYLE
Yeah, I think we should get the hell
out of here.
CHOIR TEACHER
Now, kids, let’s be a bit more open
minded. I’ve read all about this in
Newsweek. This is a ‘People’s Army’.
They are fighting the fascist policies
of their fascist government.
The Choir Teacher makes her way to a person that appears
to be the head of the group.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Hello. Do you speak-a the English?
SUBCOMMANDER MARCOS
Who are you?
CHOIR TEACHER
Oh wonderful! We were lost and it’s
such a great coincidence we found you!
You see, We are here to protest the
government sanctioned raping of your
rainforest...
The military guys look unimpressed.
CHOIR TEACHER
(Theatrically)
We are fighters, just like you. Could
you help us get back to San Jose?
No response.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Um..Oh I know! Perhaps you like a
gift!
(Theatrical)
Well, we have only one gift to give.
The gift... of song...
KIDS
AW!
She pulls her boombox out of nowhere and hits play.
Immediately the song starts.
KIDS
(Singing)
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. Zat A Doot A Waa.
There’s a place that is magical, and
full of rain! But now it needs help
because it is pain!
The Choir teacher notices that again Kyle is off. But
this time, she panics.
CHOIR TEACHER
(Nervous, under her breath)
Kyle! For the love of GOD do the right
choreography!
The Choir teacher sneaks a look at the military guys.
They all look a little pissed.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Oh Kyle, PLEASE!
But Kyle remains hopelessly off.
KIDS
(Singing)
Cleaning the earth is a mighty big
chore. But we’re spreading awareness
like never before. Getting Gay with
kids is here!
SUBCOMMANDER MARCOS
ENOUGH!
The military guys are extremely unimpressed.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
Well we hope that our gift of song has
warmed your hearts...
SUBCOMMANDER MARCOS
We’re not getting gay with any kids,
okay.
CHOIR TEACHER
Uh, yeah... So... Do you have a phone
we can use?
SUBCOMMANDER MARCOS
Yes, we have a phone. It’s right over
there next to the 12 person Jacuzzi.
He laughs. All the other soldiers start laughing too.
SUBCOMMANDER MARCOS
Now get out of here before we kill
you.
The Choir teacher thinks.
CHOIR TEACHER
If it’s because of the little Jewish
boy’s choreographyKYLE
HEY!
SUBCOMMANDER MARCOS
You white Americans make me sick. You
waste food, oil and everything else
because you’re so rich and then you
tell the rest of the world to save the
rainforest because you like its pretty
flowers.
Suddenly, a shitload of GUNFIRE breaks out!
CHOIR TEACHER
AGH!
KIDS
AGH!
SUBCOMMANDER MARCOS
RAPIDO!! RAPIDO!!
The soldiers start firing their weapons all around them.
Everyone is running and shooting guns.
Kenny gallantly steps in front of Kelly, his arms
outstretched, protecting her from any bullets.
CHOIR TEACHER
Run children! Run!!!!
The Choir teacher and kids all dash out of frame as a
couple EXPLOSIONS go off.
EXT. RAINFOREST PEACE SUMMIT - DAY
A huge crowd has shown up at the summit. The crowd is
made up of mostly American tourists and American
celebrities.
Limos pull up.
PRESIDENTE
Donde putas esta al coro? El
Espectaculo comienza pronto!
(Where the hell is our Choir?! The
show is supposed to start soon!)
MR. MACKEY
No se preocupe, El Presidente, estaran
aqui. Este evento es muy importante
para que la maestra del coro se lo
pierda, mbien.
(Don’t worry, El Presidente, they’ll
be here. This is too important for the
Choir Teacher to miss.)
EXT. FOREST - LATER
The group is walking along a river.
CHOIR TEACHER
HELLO?! ANYBODY?! HEEELLPP!!
A little kid, who is toward the front of the line reaches
out for a big, yellow flower.
KID
Wow, look at the pretty flowerCHOIR
TEACHER
Oh no no, Jake. That fragile flower is
very delicate, okay-
WHAM!!! The flower shuts on Clyde’s head like a Venus
flytrap.
CLYDE
(muffled)
OH IT HURTS!! IT HURTS!!
CHOIR TEACHER
AGAAGHH!!!
The choir teacher runs over and tries to pull out Clyde’s
flailing legs, but to no avail. The flower swallows him
up.
KELLY
(Crying)
Baha!!! I wanna go home!! I hate the
rainforest!!
Kenny puts his arm around the little girl to console her.
KENNY
Mph rm. Rmph rm.
KELLY
Oh, Lenny, hold me.
Kenny holds her closer.
KELLY
(Pulling away)
No. I can’t get attached.
She stands there for a minute. And then goes back in his
arms.
KELLY
Oh, but I do like you.
KENNY
Mph rm rKELLY
(Pulling away again)
Oh, but you’re only going to leave me.
KENNY
(Frustrated)
Mph rm rmph rm!
EXT. SAVE THE RAINFOREST SUMMIT - DAY
NEWSREPORTER
We’re here live in San Jose, Costa
Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans
have gathered for the Save the
rainforest summit. Everyone is here so
that they can feel good about
themselves, and act like they aren’t
the ones responsible for the
rainforest’s peril.
NEWSREPORTER 2
That’s right, Bob. And of course the
main attraction today is the darling
kids choir ‘Getting Gay With Kids’.
All of whom must be backstage
preparing at this very moment...
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
The group continues on. Hopelessly lost.
CHOIR TEACHER
Oh there’s just no END to this place!
I think maybe we’re going in circles.
(Checking her watch)
Oh dear God! The summit starts in an
hour! I’m going to lose my job!
She turns her head and sees that same big bug on her
back.
BUG
Roar.
CHOIR TEACHER
AGHAGAHGAH!!!!
She jumps and screams like before.
CARTMAN
This is bullcrap! I’m not following
this stupid hippie around anymore.
Carmtan starts to walk off.
CHOIR TEACHER
Eric, where are you going?
CARTMAN
I’m going this way!
CHOIR TEACHER
Young man, I am the adult here! And I
say we go THIS WAY!
CARTMAN
Look, you can stay over m-hya, but I’M
going over th-hya!
CHOIR TEACHER
YOUNG MAN I HAVE HAD IT-
CARTMAN
No,no, no, no-- You m-hya. Me th-hya.
Screw you guys... I’m going home.
Cartman walks off.
CHOIR TEACHER
GOOD! YOU DESERVE TO DIE YOU LITTLE
BASTARD!!
In a WIDE SHOT, we see Cartman walk off one way and the
rest of the class stay in the rainforest.
CHOIR TEACHER
Eric we have to stay together!!
We PAN along with Cartman.
He walks through the trees for a little bit--
CARTMAN
(While he’s walking)
God damn stupid hippie activist! I
should home nestled on the couch with
my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat
Abbot cartoons--
He walks out into a working construction site.
Bulldozers go to and fro, dozens of workmen all around.
CARTMAN
YES! I knew it! I’m saved!!!
Cartman runs off.
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
The choir teacher looks in the direction of where Cartman
went.
STAN
Hey maybe Cartman was right.
KYLE
Yeah, it happened once before.
CHOIR TEACHER
No, the spirit of Maya has told me to
go this way.
The class heads the other direction, into the forest.
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE
Cartman runs up to one of the workmen.
CARTMAN
Mister! You got to help me! I’m
starving to death!
WORKMAN
What are you doing here little boy?
CARTMAN
I was with my class and we got all
lost in the rainforest and I need
food! I’m fading fast!
WORKMAN
Lost in the rainforest?! Oh my lord?
Where are all the others?
CARTMAN
FOOD!! I HAVE TO HAVE FOOD!!!
Cartman falls on the ground melodramatically, face down,
arms splayed out.
WORKMAN
OH MY GOD! GET THIS CHILD SOME FOOD
QUICK!!!
Cartman lifts up his head for a brief second.
CARTMAN
Chicken wings.
WORKMAN
Chicken wings!
Cartman lifts his head up again.
CARTMAN
Medium spicy.
EXT. RAINFOREST PEACE SUMMIT - DAY
The crowd has gotten very anxious. They are all chanting.
CROWD
START THE SHOW! START THE SHOW! START
THE SHOW!
Again, the following is in Spanish with subtitles.
PRESIDENTE
La gente esta anciosa. Dentro de poco
se alborotan y empiezan a tiran
chochadas.
(The crowd is getting anxious. They
will start throwing things soon.)
MR. MACKEY
Estoy seguro que llegaran. Solo un
poquito mas de tiempo, mbien.
(I’m sure they’ll be here. We just
need a little more time.)
PRESIDENTE
Bueno, voy a entretenerlos con mis
chistes de polacos. Deseenme suerte.
(Well, I will try and amuse them with
my Pollock jokes. Wish me luck.)
MR. MACKEY
Mbien.
(Good.)
The Presedente takes the stage. Everyone cheers and then
quiets down.
PRESIDENTE
A cuantos polacos les toma comerse un
burrito?
(How many Pollocks does it take to eat
a burrito?)
Silence.
PRESIDENTE
Dos!
Silence.
PRESIDENTE
A cuantos polacos les toma manejar a
Panama?
(How many Pollocks does it take to
drive to Panama?)
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
The choir is still trudging through.
CHOIR TEACHER
OH GOD! This is a nightmare! We’re
NEVER going to make the festival!
STAN
Hey look over there! Isn’t that
smoke?
Stan points to some smoke drifting over the trees.
CHOIR TEACHER
Let’s go, quickly!
They all run.
EXT. FOREST CLEARING
They run into the clearing to find a small fire burning.
KYLE
Hey, it’s a fire! That means there
must be people!
There is a rustling in the bushes. And then they step
out, the little, three foot tall Yanagopa people. They
all carry spears and look ridiculous.
CHOIR TEACHER
Children! It’s the Yanagopa!
The Yanagopa look nervous, but gather in a circle around
the group.
CHOIR TEACHER
Do not be afraid. We are not here to
tear down your rainforest...
YANAGOPA
Tom tilly ye?
CHOIR TEACHER
Look at how they live in peace with
all living things. Gentle, nobleBut
even she knows how stupid she sounds.
CHOIR TEACHER
RUN FOR YOUR LIVES CHILDREN!!!
Just then, the tribesman all throw their spears at once
into the Choir Teacher’s head. She looks like a porcupine
just got to her.
She stands there for a minute... ThenCHOIR
TEACHER
OW!
YANAGOPAS
(chanting)
Tom tilly ye! Tom tilly ye! Tom tilly
ye! Tom tilly ye!
STAN
Holy crap!
Everybody starts running. Yanagopas pursue them with
their spears. As the Choir Teacher runs, the spears fall
out of her head.
Kyle and Stan run through the jungle as spears go flying
by.
STAN
JESUS CHRIST!
CHOIR TEACHER
RUN RUN RUN!!!!
The Choir teacher looks behind her and again sees the
same bug on her back.
BUG
Roar.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont’d)
AGHAGAHG!!!!!
She jumps until it flies away.
Kelly falls down!
KELLY
AAGH!!
The Yanagopa almost get to her, but Kenny runs back into
frame, picks her up and carries her away as she picks her
nose.
KELLY
Benny!
The entire class runs headlong through the shallow
puddle. They immediately start sinking.
KYLE
What the hell!?
STAN
I’m sinking!!!
CHOIR TEACHER
It’s quicksand!
The headhunters all stand around the quicksand holding
spears and poison dart guns ready.
They are trapped.
HEADHUNTERS
Tom tilly ye!
EXT. HEADHUNTERS VILLAGE - DAY
Random people’s heads are on poles in the little village.
The children are sitting, alone, tied up around a fire.
STAN
All we ever heard about growing up was
‘Save the Rainforest’, ‘The Rainforest
is Fragile’...
KYLE
Yeah. Fragile my ass.
KELLY
Larry, if we make it out of this, I
want to be your girlfriend. Even if we
do live in different places. I don’t
care.
KENNY
Mph rm rmph.
Kelly struggles to pick her nose, but can’t with her
hands tied.
Ms. Stevens is tied up like Fay Rae in King Kong. She is
dressed in a cheerleader outfit.
CHOIR TEACHER
Okay... Just what the heck is going on
here people?
The Yanagopa do a little dance around her.
YANAGOPA
Too la bil-le! Too la bil-le! Too la
bil-le! Too la bil-le.
As they sing, a HUGE yanagopa comes out. He is the size
of a small house, with a big fat belly.
GIANT YANAGOPA
(Super deep)
Tom Ti li ye!
CHOIR TEACHER
AAAGHGH!!!
KELLY
Oh no! That big thing is going to make
love to Ms. Stevens!!
CHOIR TEACHER
ALRIGHT, THAT DOES IT!! GOD DAMN
STUPID ASS RAINFOREST!!
The kids look surprised.
CHOIR TEACHER
THIS PLACE FUCKING SUCKS!! I WAS
WRONG!!! FUCK THE RAINFOREST!!! I
FUCKING HATE IT!!! I FUCKING HATE
IT!!!!!
STAN
Oh, now she figures it out.
WHHOOOOOSH!!! Suddenly, a huge bulldozer comes flying
through the trees. Driving it is the workman from the
construction site.
WORKMAN
Quick! Everybody help the children!
The headhunters all run away screaming as the workmen run
towards the kids.
The guy driving the bulldozer slams into two of the
headhunters, killing them both. Then he drives over some
snakes and that large bug for good measure.
STAN
Wow!
KYLE
Dude! Bulldozers RULE!!
WORKMAN
Come on! Let’s get you back to
civilization!!!
KIDS
Hooray!!!
CHOIR TEACHER
Hooray children!!
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE
The class and several workman are in the construction
site. The kids are all munching down on hot dogs and
everybody has some lemonade.
CHOIR TEACHER
How did you know where we were?
WORKMAN
Your little friend helped me outCartman
walks up.
CHOIR TEACHER
Eric?
CARTMAN
Who did you expect? Merv Griffin?
CHOIR TEACHER
What exactly are you guys doing out
here with all this construction
equipment?
WORKMAN
We’re clearing out big sections of the
rainforest for a lumber yard.
CHOIR TEACHER
Really? That’s great!
WORKMAN
You mean, you don’t mind?
CHOIR TEACHER
No! I hate the rainforest! You go
right ahead and plow down this whole
fucking thing!
WORKMAN
That’s swell!
KELLY
Okay, Benny, so in order for our long
distance relationship to work, we’ll
have to call each other every other
day.
KENNY
Mph rm.
Just then, lightning strikes and Kenny falls over dead.
KELLY
AHAGAH!!! LENNY?! LENNY?! NO!!!
No answer. Stan and Kyle walk up.
STAN
OH MY GOD! THEY KILLED KENNY!
KYLE
YOU BASTARDS!!
KELLY
WHAT?! WHO?! WHO KILLED HIM?!
Stan and Kyle look confused.
STAN
THEY did.
KELLY
Who’s THEY?
STAN
You know... They.
KYLE
They’re..they’re bastards.
KELLY
Well don’t just stand there! Help him!
Now they look REALLY confused.
KYLE
What?
STAN
Help... him?
KELLY
(In disgust)
UGH!!
Kelly runs over to Kenny, pinches his nose, and starts
giving him mouth to mouth.
KELLY
Come on, Benny, breathe! Breathe you
son of a BITCH!
Kelly pounds five times on Kenny’s chest, picking her
nose quickly between the third and fourth. Finally, we
hear a COUGH.
We see only Kelly’s face as she smiles.
KYLE
(Amazed)
Woa, dude!
EXT. RAINFOREST PEACE SUMMIT
The kids are up on the stage singing to the huge
audience.
ANNOUNCER
And now, here to teach us about the
rainforest is GETTING GAY WITH KIDS!!!
The curtain opens, revealing the kids and the choir
teacher.
CHOIR TEACHER
Does everybody have the new lyrics?
They nod.
CHOIR TEACHER (cont'd)

(singing)
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. Zat A Doot A Waa.

rainforest before. Getting Gay With

They continue their anti-rainforest song. We reveal that

The crowd goes wild.
MAN

WOMAN

KIDS
(singing)
Someday if you work hard boys and

illnesses.
“There are over seven hundred things in the
Rainforest that cause cancer. ”
“Join the fight now and help stop the Rainforest
before its too late.”
