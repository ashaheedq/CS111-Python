Q. To what extent do artificial languages (such as Python or Picobot) have the ability to shape human thought, if at all? Or are such languages fundamentally different from human ones, such as Guugu Yimithirr or English?

A. In my opinion, I do not believe that artificial languages are capable of shaping human thinking. Although, there are robots that capable of doing what a human kind can do, however, in the end, it all programmed and created by the human. They are utterly distinct than the languages we speak.
