Based on the information in the articles, how can computer scientists and others who develop computational models ensure that their models are correct? Is it even possible to do so?

When scientists in general want to develop models - which is of course based on math - they are also calculating the margin of error. The margin of error is a statistic expressing the amount of random sampling error in a survey's results. it is not possible to predict what will happen in the future precisely; however, scientists put a lot of effort to minimize the margin of error to its lowest to get nearly a perfect predication. Yet, there are other factors that may changed the prediction to a completely different outcome. I believe these factors are unpredictable. But, again, scientists uses current situations to make models %99 correct.
