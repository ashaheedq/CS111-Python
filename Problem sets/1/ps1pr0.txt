2. The article states that, whether in science or business, we “don’t have to settle for models at all.” Do you agree or disagree with this statement? How? And why? Certainly feel free to articulate a more nuanced or hybrid view, if you’d like. 
I disagree with what Chris Anderson stated in his article. I believe that having Petabytes of data is truly useful for scientits research and discoveries. In fact, I actually think that we could cure cancer with those collected data in the future. However, having a model is obsolete, indeed it is a requirement to have the bigger picture of things. I do not think that with pure data we would be able to advance beyond the optimal use of the data.
