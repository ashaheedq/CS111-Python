What is an application that (in your opinion) Watson’s technology might be able to contribute to? Alternatively, do you feel Watson’s capabilities will not make much of an impact?

A. One application that it would be great contribution to the humanity is to see Watson’s technology in the medical field. I think that one day computers will describe our medications and perform certain surgery like those really difficult operations that takes a lot of time or at least helping the doctor performing it.
